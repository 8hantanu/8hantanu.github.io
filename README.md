# Hey there! 👋

I am **Shantanu Mishra** a.k.a. **[8hantanu](wiki/self/about#8hantanu)** across the web  🌻

I am a systems software engineer based in Hyderabad, primarily working on systems emulation at [AMD](https://www.amd.com).
Emerging technologies and research in AI, high-performance computing, and robotics fascinate me.
In my leisure, I try to make new things at [Yree](https://yree.io). 

To maintain a healthy balance, I enjoy running and occasionally engage in sports like tennis, badminton, and futsal.
Also, I am always in need of book recommendations in thriller, psychology, and sci-fi. 
Whenever I get a chance, I love to travel and experience new things.
