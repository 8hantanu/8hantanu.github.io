# Hey there! 👋

I am **Shantanu Mishra**, a.k.a. **[8hantanu](wiki/self/about#8hantanu)** across the web. 

A systems software engineer based in Hyderabad, primarily working on systems emulation at [AMD](https://www.amd.com).
In my leisure, I try to make new things at [Yree](https://yree.io).

A minimalist who enjoys reading and thrives on running.
I find myself mostly writing and organizing – this website being a testament to that!
Whenever I get a chance, I love to travel and experience new things.
