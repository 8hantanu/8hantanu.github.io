# Hey there! üëã

I am **Shantanu Mishra**, a.k.a. **[8hantanu](wiki/self/about#8hantanu)** across the web. 

A software engineer based in Cambridge, UK, working on AI systems.
In my leisure, I try to make new things at [Yree](https://yree.io).

I enjoy reading and running.
I find myself mostly writing and organizing ‚Äî this website being a testament to that!
Whenever I get a chance, I love to [travel](wiki/self/experiences/travel/) and experience new things.

Have a look around.

- **[wiki](wiki)** ‚Äî my collection of random things
- **[feed](feed)** ‚Äî posts from my bsky feed
- **[yree](https://yree.io)** ‚Äî things I make
- **[more](wiki/wander)** ‚Äî are you feeling lucky?
